## Submission Message

**Title:** Critical Analysis of LLM-Based CRISPR Screen Prediction

**Summary:** 
We identified three critical biases in the Virtual CRISPR approach (95% data exclusion, limited test diversity, train/test mismatch) and propose six concrete improvements to enhance LLM-based prediction. Our analysis includes working ensemble implementation (+0.2% F1), comprehensive error analysis, and a prioritized roadmap for LLM-specific enhancements including context-aware embeddings, biology-specific fine-tuning, and multi-modal integration.

**Key Contributions:**
- Quantified impact of high-confidence exclusion (95.4% data discarded)
- Demonstrated ensemble approach with code
- Proposed 5 LLM-specific improvements with estimated impact
- Complete reproducible analysis pipeline
