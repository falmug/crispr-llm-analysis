# Critical Analysis of LLM-Based CRISPR Screen Prediction

**Hackathon Project: Evidence-Based Evaluation with Focus on Balanced Performance**

## üéØ Executive Summary

We provide a rigorous analysis of the "Virtual CRISPR" approach (Song et al., 2025), focusing on:
1. **Balanced performance metrics** (F1 + False Positive Rate)
2. **Evidence-based bias identification** (3 fundamental limitations)
3. **Creative LLM-specific improvements** (6 concrete proposals)
4. **Proper evaluation methodology** (train/val/test, statistical validation)

**Key Finding:** Random Forest achieves **F1=0.909 with FPR=0.15** using official embeddings - a well-balanced model suitable for practical deployment.

## üìä Results with Official Embeddings

### Model Performance (Test Set, n=363)

| Model | F1 | AUROC | **FPR** | Precision | Recall |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Random Forest** | **0.909** | **0.921** | **0.15** | **0.907** | **0.912** |
| Gradient Boosting | 0.901 | 0.887 | 0.21 | 0.896 | 0.906 |
| MLP Neural Network | 0.859 | 0.906 | 0.24 | 0.898 | 0.823 |
| Logistic Regression | 0.909 | 0.872 | 0.15 | 0.907 | 0.912 |
| Simple Ensemble (Avg) | 0.907 | 0.912 | 0.16 | 0.902 | 0.912 |

**Why Random Forest?**
- ‚úÖ High F1 (0.909) AND low FPR (0.15)
- ‚úÖ Balanced performance (precision ‚âà recall)
- ‚úÖ Suitable for practical deployment
- ‚úÖ More reliable than models with high FPR

### Why Ensemble Didn't Help (Important Insight!)

**Result:** Simple averaging ensemble (F1=0.907) performed **worse** than RF alone (F1=0.909)

**Root causes:**
1. Weak MLP (F1=0.859) dragged down the average
2. Models made similar errors (insufficient diversity)
3. Simple averaging gives equal weight to weak predictors

**Lesson learned:** Ensemble only helps when:
- All components are individually strong, OR
- Models make different types of errors (true diversity), OR
- Using sophisticated weighting (e.g., stacking)

**This negative result is valuable** - it teaches us about the importance of model diversity and proper ensemble design.

## üîç Three Evidence-Based Biases

### 1. Training Set Imbalance (7.74% positive)
**Source:** Paper Section 3

**Evidence:**
- Training: 7.74% positive (1:12 ratio)
- Test: 50% positive (artificially balanced via inversion)

**Impact:**
- Real-world deployment will face ~7.74% hit rate
- Test performance may not reflect real-world FPR
- Class imbalance affects any model approach

---

### 2. Limited Test Diversity (2 papers, 900 genes)
**Source:** Measured from benchmark data

**Evidence:**
- Only 2 source papers (PMID 39567689, 39385035)
- Only 2 cell lines (glioblastoma, lung carcinoma)
- Only 4 phenotypes tested
- Small sample size (n=1,814) ‚Üí high variance

**Impact:**
- Uncertain generalization to other contexts
- High variance in performance estimates

---

### 3. High-Confidence Filtering (extreme cases only)
**Source:** Paper Section 2.2

**Evidence:**
- HIT = Strong effect in expected direction
- NO-HIT = Strong effect in OPPOSITE direction
- EXCLUDED = Weak/ambiguous/no effect

**Impact:**
- Model trained only on extreme cases
- Unknown performance on subtle biological effects

## üí° Six Creative LLM-Specific Improvements

*Focus: Novel approaches beyond hyperparameter optimization*

### 1. Context-Aware Embeddings ‚Üí Target: FPR Reduction

**Current:** Static gene embedding regardless of context
**Proposed:** Embed "gene X in cell Y affecting phenotype Z" as unified context
**Expected Impact:** +3-5% F1, reduced FPR through context awareness

### 2. Knowledge Graph Integration ‚Üí Target: FPR Reduction

**Current:** No structured biological knowledge
**Proposed:** Integrate pathway databases (KEGG, Reactome) with RAG
**Expected Impact:** +5-8% F1, 30-40% FPR reduction via biological plausibility checks

### 3. Biology-Specific LLM Fine-Tuning

**Current:** General-purpose embeddings
**Proposed:** Fine-tune on gene descriptions, pathways, CRISPR literature
**Expected Impact:** +5-10% F1 (BioLinkBERT showed ~7% on biomedical tasks)

### 4. Multi-Modal Integration

**Current:** Text only
**Proposed:** Text + expression + structure + networks
**Expected Impact:** +10-15% F1

### 5. Uncertainty Quantification

**Current:** Point predictions
**Proposed:** Conformal prediction for confidence intervals
**Impact:** Users can filter high-uncertainty predictions (reduce effective FPR)

### 6. Active Learning

**Current:** All high-confidence hits
**Proposed:** Iteratively select informative borderline cases
**Expected Impact:** 40-60% labeling cost reduction

## üî¨ Methodology

**Data:** Official embeddings from `/projects/bfqi/data_test_difficult/`

**Split:**
- Train: 60% (1,088 examples)
- Validation: 20% (363 examples) - threshold tuning only
- Test: 20% (363 examples) - never seen during training

**Key Principles:**
- ‚úÖ No test set leakage
- ‚úÖ Focus on balanced metrics (F1 + FPR)
- ‚úÖ Honest reporting (negative results are valuable)

## üéØ Key Insights

1. **Balanced Metrics Matter** - F1 alone insufficient, FPR critical
2. **Ensemble Doesn't Always Help** - Understanding failure is valuable
3. **Focus on Creative Solutions** - Not hyperparameter tweaking
4. **Biases Are Fundamental** - Affect any model approach

## üí° Recommendations

**For Deployment:**
1. Prioritize low FPR (avoid wasted experiments)
2. Implement uncertainty quantification
3. Use knowledge graph integration
4. Test on imbalanced data

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Random split (in-distribution) vs new papers (out-of-distribution)
- Simpler models vs production 100M parameter MLP
- Proof of concept, not production system

**Bottom Line:** RF achieves F1=0.909, FPR=0.15 using official embeddings. Ensemble averaging failed (valuable insight). We propose 6 creative LLM improvements focused on FPR reduction rather than marginal optimization.
